This project providea a step-by-step guide to implementing these features in your Spring Boot application. It contains how to configure Spring Security to work with JWT, define data models and associations for authentication and authorization, use Spring Data JPA to interact with H2 Database, and create REST controllers. You will also learn how to handle exceptions, define payloads, and run and check your application.

The project will cover the following topics:

Spring Security: A powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework.

OAuth JWT: A secure and efficient way to handle authentication and authorization between different parties.

HttpOnly Cookie: A cookie attribute that prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie.

AuthFilter: A filter that intercepts requests and performs authentication and authorization checks.

MySQL Database: A widely-used, open-source relational database management system that supports SQL and JDBC and can operate in-memory for lightweight and fast data processing.
